## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Daraja API complexity**: Start integration early, use sandbox extensively
- **POS sync reliability**: Implement robust error handling and retries
- **Performance on mobile**: Optimize images and implement lazy loading

### Medium Risk
- **Database connection limits**: Use connection pooling, consider Neon/Supabase
- **Search performance**: Index optimization, consider Algolia fallback
- **Payment reconciliation**: Implement idempotency and audit logs

### Low Risk
- **UI/UX consistency**: Use design system and component library
- **Code quality**: Automated testing and code reviews
- **Deployment issues**: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
